## About
Cruelty Squad Online (CruS Online) is a huge modification for game [Cruelty Squad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1388770/Cruelty_Squad/) that add a lobby style LAN multiplayer

## Installation
CruS Online is installed in the same way as other modifications

1. Install [CruS Modloader](https://github.com/CruS-Modding-Infrastructure/crus-modloader)
2. Download latest version of CruS Online from [here](https://github.com/TriggeredP/crus-online/releases)
3. Extract CruS Online folder into this directory: `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\mods`
4. Launch the game

## Hosting lobby
Due to the fact that the modification adds LAN multiplayer, there are two ways to host the lobby:

1. Port forwarding
2. Using a VPN software (like Radmin VPN)

The best way would be to port forwarding because this will help improve performance, but if you can't forward ports, you can use Radmin VPN or similar applications

Also, the host must have a good computer, otherwise it may affect performance

To create a lobby in the game, you need to:

1. Open the CruS Online menu (The second icon in the main menu)
2. Go to the `Host` tab and set the port (It doesn't matter if Radmin VPN is used)
3. Go to the `Main` tab and click to a `Host` button
4. Share IP and port with those you are going to play with

## Connecting to lobby
After the host has created a lobby, players must:

1. Open the CruS Online menu (The second icon in the main menu)
2. Enter the IP and port received from the host
3. Press `Join` button

## Starting game
After everyone has entered the lobby, players must choose weapons and implants

Once all the players are ready the host must select a level and press `Start misson` button to play map from the main game

You can also play maps embedded in the modification, they can be found in the CruS Online menu in the `DM` tab

After the game starts, players will not be able to join the lobby

## Usefull information

You can change the nickname, color and skin in the `Player` tab
